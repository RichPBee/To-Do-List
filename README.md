# To-Do-List

Creating a simple to-do list app using vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
The app should allow a user to enter a string to add to the list of todo
items, as well as edit the items once added, check them off and delete 
checked items. Added functionality may include a remove button for each
individual item, and a "multi-page" functioon for more than a given
number of todo items. 

Part of the focus of this project is speed, and building confidence
with DOM manipulation via event listeners and creating/appending nodes.
Therefore, I will timestamp and date the README at time of starting and 
time of completion.
